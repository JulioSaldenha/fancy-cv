% Here we set up the data required for the title.
% In time, I hope to be able to let variable numbers of icons/contacts
% be defined.
%
% To be tested: what happens when one of the fields is not included?
%
% Probably I need to put in some class errors
%
% Use the existing LaTeX command author for name on CV
\author{Sam Bell}
% Specify the role that we are applying for.
\role{Biomodeler}
% Field for your location/address.
% TO TEST: how to make it work when the address is long.
\address{Val-de-Marne, France.}
% Phone number. I don't think I need to make this unbreakable spaces.
% I wonder if there is a way to make all of the spaces turn into un-
% breakable spaces.

% Entering in your email address. Would be cool if it told you it was a valid email or not...

% A place to enter a personal statement.
% This, at the moment, has no flexibility in layout. It appears at full
% textwidth across the page.
\summary{Theoretical biophysicist specialised in stochastic systems and critical phenomena. Strong ability to translate problems into mathematical models, investigate these models, and communicate the results to a wider audience.}

% As with many LaTeX classes, one calls \maketitle when we have written
% all of the fields we want to include in the top matter.
